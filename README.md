# Image_classification  
## Image Classification using Logistic Regression and SVM with Feature Engineering  
### Overview  
This project implements image classification using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification models are trained using feature-engineered representations of images instead of raw pixel data to improve performance.  

## Key Features  
Feature Engineering: Extracts meaningful features such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Color Histograms, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP).
Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear classifier for binary and multi-class image classification.  
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful classifier that leverages kernel techniques for better decision boundaries.  
Dataset Handling: Uses standard image datasets and applies preprocessing steps such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and normalization.  
Performance Evaluation: Evaluates models using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
